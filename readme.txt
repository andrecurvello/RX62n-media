//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This is a stripped down version of FreeRTOS 6.1.0 that runs on the Renesas
YRDKRX62N demo board.

I have removed Windows specific build artifacts and a heap of uneeded code for
other ports/board to make it easier to grep the code and get relevent results.

It includes makefiles to build under Linux, and an LCD display driver.

The standard FreeRTOS demos are built by default.
